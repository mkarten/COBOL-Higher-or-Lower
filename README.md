#### Features
    - Higher or Lower basic functionalities
    - Exit the game while playing
    - Difficulty system
    - Score reward based on the difficulty


## Acknowledgements
Despite the fact that it is an old programing language it is still powering a lot of banking application
For example it is still used in the __IBM Mainframe__ or as we call it the big iron

To go further on how and why COBOL is still in use i will recommend readin theese articles :
- [Why COBOL a 60 year old language is comming back](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/)
- [The inevitable return of COBOL](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/the-inevitable-return-of-cobol/)
- [The future of cobol is now](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3596594/the-future-of-cobol-is-now.html)
## Running the game

You have two ways of running the game :

- Use the precompiled executable in the __bin folder__
- Compile the binaries yourself with the __cobc COBOL compiler__

#### For running the precompiled executable
simply run the .exe file in the bin folder called __Higher-or-Lower.exe__

Note That since it was compiled on a windows machine i dont know if th libraries ar compatible with Linux or Mac and will recommand compiling the binaries yourself

#### For compiling the binaries yourself
To compile the binaries by yourself you will firstly need on of the two :

- OpenCobolIDE ([Official download link](https://launchpad.net/cobcide/+download))
- GnuCOBOL ([Official download link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/))

you can use either of theese to compile the .cbl file name __Higher-or-Lower.cbl__
it will produce an executable that you will able to run on your platform and enjoy
